                    <p class="article-intro"><strong>In feng shui, the bathroom is considered a place where energy
                            naturally drains away.</strong> Water flows down and out, taking chi (life force energy)
                        with it. This is why bathroom placement and management are crucial for maintaining wealth,
                        health, and harmony in your home.</p>

                    <p>The good news? With proper feng shui cures and mindful practices, you can minimize the negative
                        effects and even transform your bathroom into a spa-like sanctuary that supports your wellbeing.
                    </p>

                    <h2 id="why-bathrooms-matter">🚽 Why Bathroom Feng Shui Matters</h2>

                    <p>In traditional feng shui, bathrooms represent the water element in its draining aspect. Unlike
                        fountains (which circulate and activate), bathroom water literally leaves your home—and takes
                        energy with it.</p>

                    <h3>Key Concerns:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Wealth drainage:</strong> If your bathroom is in the wealth corner (Southeast),
                            money may slip away easily</li>
                        <li><strong>Health issues:</strong> Bathrooms in the center of the home can affect the entire
                            family's health</li>
                        <li><strong>Relationship problems:</strong> Bathroom facing bedroom or bed can impact romance
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Career obstacles:</strong> Bathroom in the career sector (North) may slow
                            professional growth</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 id="critical-rules">⚠️ 7 Critical Bathroom Feng Shui Rules</h2>

                    <h3>Rule 1: Keep the Toilet Lid Closed</h3>
                    <p>This is the #1 most important rule. An open toilet is like a visible drain for your wealth and
                        energy. <strong>Always keep the lid down, especially when flushing.</strong></p>

                    <div class="tip-box">
                        <strong>💡 Pro Tip:</strong> Make this a household rule. Explain to family members that it's not
                        just about hygiene—it's about keeping prosperity in your home!
                    </div>

                    <h3>Rule 2: Close the Bathroom Door</h3>
                    <p>Always keep the bathroom door closed when not in use. This contains the draining energy and
                        prevents it from affecting other areas of your home.</p>

                    <h3>Rule 3: Fix All Leaks Immediately</h3>
                    <p>Dripping faucets and leaking toilets represent continuous wealth drainage. In feng shui, this is
                        literally money going down the drain. <strong>Fix leaks within 24 hours if possible.</strong>
                    </p>

                    <h3>Rule 4: Hide Plumbing and Drains</h3>
                    <p>Visible pipes and open drains are constant reminders of energy leaving. Use drain covers and
                        under-sink storage to conceal plumbing.</p>

                    <h3>Rule 5: No Mirrors Facing Toilet</h3>
                    <p>A mirror facing the toilet doubles the draining energy. If you must have a mirror in this
                        position, consider frosted or decorated alternatives.</p>

                    <h3>Rule 6: Never Position Bathroom Above Kitchen</h3>
                    <p>If your home has a bathroom directly above the kitchen (especially above the stove), this creates
                        a significant feng shui conflict. Water energy pressing down on fire energy can cause health and
                        financial problems.</p>

                    <h3>Rule 7: Avoid Bathroom Facing Front Door</h3>
                    <p>When chi enters through your front door and immediately sees a bathroom, it's drawn to drain away
                        before circulating through your home.</p>

                    <h2 id="problem-placements">🏠 Problem Bathroom Placements & Cures</h2>

                    <h3>Bathroom in Wealth Corner (Southeast)</h3>
                    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Your prosperity sector literally has a drain in it.</p>
                    <p><strong>Cure:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Add wood element plants (real or high-quality silk)</li>
                        <li>Use green and brown color accents</li>
                        <li>Place a healthy potted plant on the toilet tank</li>
                        <li>Keep bathroom exceptionally clean</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Bathroom in Center of Home</h3>
                    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> The center (Tai Chi) affects all aspects of life. A bathroom here can
                        impact the whole family's health and luck.</p>
                    <p><strong>Cure:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use earth element colors (yellows, beiges, terracotta)</li>
                        <li>Keep very bright lighting (fire element creates earth)</li>
                        <li>Add crystals or stones around the bathroom</li>
                        <li>Use all cures consistently</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Bathroom Facing Bedroom</h3>
                    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Draining energy directed at your rest space affects sleep and
                        relationships.</p>
                    <p><strong>Cure:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use a solid door (not glass or louvered)</li>
                        <li>Keep door closed and consider a door sweep</li>
                        <li>Hang a crystal between bathroom and bed</li>
                        <li>Use a curtain or screen as an additional barrier</li>
                    </ul>

                    <div class="product-recommendation">
                        <h3>1. Himalayan Salt Lamp</h3>
                        <p>Salt is a powerful purifier in feng shui. A small salt lamp in the bathroom absorbs negative
                            energy, releases negative ions, and creates a warm, spa-like atmosphere. The amber glow also
                            adds the fire element to balance water.</p>
                        <p><strong>Best placement:</strong> Near the window or on a shelf away from water splash.</p>

                    <div class="product-recommendation">
                        <h3>2. Bamboo Plants</h3>
                        <p>Lucky bamboo thrives in humid environments, making it perfect for bathrooms. Wood element is
                            used to weaken water (in the destructive cycle), helping to reduce the draining effect.</p>
                        <p><strong>Best placement:</strong> On the toilet tank, windowsill, or counter.</p>
                        <a href="shop.html" class="btn btn-outline">View on Shop →</a>

                    <div class="product-recommendation">
                        <h3>3. Essential Oil Diffuser</h3>
                        <p>Aromatherapy with eucalyptus, peppermint, or lavender purifies the air and lifts the energy.
                            The upward motion of the mist also symbolically reverses the draining effect.</p>
                        <p><strong>Best scents:</strong> Eucalyptus (cleansing), Mint (refreshing), Lavender (calming).
                        </p>

                        <p>Black tourmaline near the toilet absorbs negative energy. Amethyst on the counter promotes
                            relaxation. Clear quartz purifies and amplifies positive intentions.</p>
                        <p><strong>Best placement:</strong> Small bowl of tumbled stones on the counter or shelf.</p>

                                <p itemprop="text">Yes! Choose low-light tolerant plants like pothos, snake plant, or
                                    lucky bamboo. You can also use high-quality silk plants if natural light is
                                    impossible. The key is to add wood element to weaken the water energy.</p>

                                <p itemprop="text">Keep both doors closed when not in use. Hang a faceted crystal ball
                                    between them to disperse energy. Use a full-length curtain inside the bathroom door
